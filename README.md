# Let's Chat

## Description

The aim of this project is to build a chat app for mobile devices using React Native. The app will provide users with a chat interface and options to share images and their location.

## Purpose of this App

Chat App was developed to provide an opportunity to learn about native app development, and hone the relevant skills.


### Key Features
* A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen before joining the chat.
* A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button.
* The chat must provide users with two additional communication features: sending images
and location data.
* Data gets stored online and offline.

### Technology Used

I used **React Native** to create this mobile chat app. 
**React Native**
*Enables the coding of a functional app that can be used on different OS (iOS and Android), while using one programming language


**Expo**
*Used as a development environment to develop and test the app via phone simulator, web, and on physical smart phone.

**Gifted Chat**
*The library was used to create the UI of the Chat App such as the message bubbles

**Firestore**
*Database that comes with Google Firebase
*Eliminates the need to write backend code for database queries

### What challenges did I face, what did I learn?
* When working on this project sometimes the code breaks because dependencies do not work on the new updates. This resulted in having to downgrade to the lower version in order for the app to function properly. 
* I learned that Gifted Chat has many features besides the bubble chat that I have not implemented in this project such as adding videos, date formats, and mic recording features
